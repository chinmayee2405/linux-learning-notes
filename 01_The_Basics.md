###  History

Hey rookie! Welcome to the world of Linux — it’s going to be an awesome ride! Let’s rewind a bit:

- 1969: Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs create UNIX.
- UNIX evolves and is rewritten in C for portability.
- 1983: Richard Stallman starts the GNU Project aiming for a free OS.
- The GNU General Public License (GPL) is created, but the kernel (Hurd) never finishes.
- The kernel is the core that allows software to talk to hardware.
- Other systems like BSD and MINIX existed but lacked a unified kernel.
- 1991: Linus Torvalds starts development on what becomes the Linux kernel.

###  Choosing a Linux Distribution

A Linux system is generally divided into three parts:
- Hardware – The physical components like CPU, RAM, and storage.
- Kernel – The core of the system that manages hardware interaction.
- User Space – Where users interact with the system through GUI or CLI.
