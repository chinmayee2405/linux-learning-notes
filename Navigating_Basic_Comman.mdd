# Basic Command Syntax

This module focuses exclusively on the **CLI (Command Line Interface)**, not the **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**. The CLI terminal is a powerful tool commonly used to manage:

- Low-power devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi)
- Cloud servers
- Network appliances
- And everything in between

A basic understanding of the terminal is **essential** for diagnosing and fixing most Linux-based systems. Even if you're working primarily with non-Linux systems, learning the CLI is still incredibly useful.

## What Is a Command?

A **command** is a program or script that, when executed on the command line, performs an action on the system. It runs a process that:
- Takes input
- Manipulates data
- Produces output

Example:

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos
ls is a command that lists files and directories in the current directory.

Command names are usually mnemonic (easy to remember) based on their purpose.

# Case Sensitivity
Linux commands are case-sensitive:

bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ LS
-bash: /usr/games/LS: Permission denied
ls (lowercase) works.

LS (uppercase) is a different, non-existent command.

# General Command Syntax
Most commands follow this pattern:

bash
command [options] [arguments]
Command – The program to run (ls, mkdir, rm, etc.)
Options – Flags that modify the command's behavior (e.g., -l, -a)
Arguments – Targets the command acts on (e.g., a file or directory)
Example:
bash
ls -l /home/sysadmin
ls → command

-l → option (long listing format)

/home/sysadmin → argument (target directory)

# Summary
Commands are tools executed in the terminal to perform actions.
-Most follow a consistent command [options] [arguments] syntax.
-Linux is case-sensitive — always check capitalization.
-Start small with commands like ls, pwd, cd, and build up your CLI fluency.
